        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Hare Rama Chakraborthy, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my 
        website. I'm an 18-year-old second-year student at Chennai Institute of Technology (CIT),
        pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I chose this 
        field because I believe that AI and data science will shape the future and have a 
        profound impact on society, and I'm excited to be a part of that.</p>

        <p>Since a young age, I've been fascinated by computers. While my career aspirations have
        evolved over time, my love for exploring new computer science topics has never wavered. 
        In particular, I developed an interest in web development which is why you're here 
        reading this text right now. I realized that I have a passion for creating websites and 
        applications that make life easier and more enjoyable for users.</p>

        <p>Through this website, I'm excited to share my skills and projects with you. Thank you for 
          visiting!

      <div class="about-me-individual" id="interests">
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I'm always eager to learn about new things and explore different areas of interest. 
          Here are some of the subjects that currently have my attention:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Coding</strong>:  I find coding to be an exciting and rewarding pursuit. 
            The creativity and problem-solving aspects of programming are both challenging and 
            satisfying.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Development</strong>: As someone who values elegant design and user 
            experience, I enjoy the challenge of creating web applications that are both 
            functional and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Science</strong>: I am deeply interested in the ways that data 
            can be harnessed to provide insights into complex phenomena, and I am constantly 
            exploring new techniques for data analysis and machine learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Reading books</strong>: I am an avid reader and find great pleasure in 
            losing myself in a good book. For me, reading books is a way to gain new insights and
            perspectives. The ideas and stories contained in books have the power to enrich our 
            lives and expand our understanding of the world around us.</li>
            <li><strong>Football</strong>: There's nothing quite like the thrill of watching a 
            great game of football unfold. From the opening kickoff to the final whistle, I am 
            captivated by the skill and technique of the players and the strategic battles taking
            place on the field.</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophy</strong>: For me, philosophy is all about exploring different 
            perspectives and ways of thinking. As a firm believer of the scientific method and the 
            value of philosophy, I love how philosophy challenges me to question my own 
            assumptions and biases, and to consider alternative viewpoints. It encourages
            us to think critically and creatively about the world around us, which I find both 
            stimulating and rewarding.</li>
            <li><strong>Psychology</strong>: Psychology is an endlessly fascinating subject that 
            offers insights into the mysteries of the human mind. Whether you're interested in 
            social psychology, cognitive psychology, or neuroscience, there's always something 
            new to learn and discover.</li>
            <li><strong>Language learning</strong>: Language learning is like a mental workout
            for me. I enjoy the challenge of learning new grammar rules and vocabulary, and I 
            find it rewarding to see my progress over time. It's a great way to keep my mind 
            sharp and active.</li>
          </ol>
