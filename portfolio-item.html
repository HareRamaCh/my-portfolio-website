        <p><strong>Turtle</strong> is a Python library that enables users to create a virtual
        canvas for drawing pictures and interactive shapes. It provides a fun and intuitive way
        for beginners to learn programming fundamentals, while also allowing them to explore more
        advanced concepts. I have used Turtle to recreate classic games such as 
        <strong>Pong</strong> and <strong>Snake</strong>, as well as a game called 
        <strong>Turtle Race</strong>. You can find below a description of these three games 
        along with some screenshots.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Pong</h3></li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/pong-screenshot.png">
        <p>In my recreation of Pong using Python's turtle module, players control paddles on 
           either side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is to make the ball 
           miss the opponent's paddle and score points. The game features simple graphics 
           mimicking the original Pong game released by Atari in 1972. The game is played in a 
           two-dimensional space with a single ball and two paddles. The Python code handles 
           collision detection, score keeping, and other game mechanics. Overall, the recreation 
           of Pong using Python's turtle module is a fun and engaging way to experience the 
           classic game in a new way.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Snake</h3></li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/snake-screenshot.png">
        <p>In my recreation of Snake using Python's turtle module, players control a snake that 
           moves around the screen, eating food to grow in length while avoiding walls and its 
           own tail. The game features simple graphics reminiscent of the classic Snake game 
           popularized on Nokia mobile phones. The Python code handles movement, collision 
           detection, and score keeping. As players progress through the game, the snake grows 
           longer, making it more challenging to avoid obstacles. Snake is a fun and addictive 
           game that is sure to provide hours of entertainment for players of all ages.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Turtle Race</h3></li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/turtle-race-screenshot.png">
        <p>Turtle Race lets players choose one of the seven VIBGYOR colors. Seven turtles then 
           line up for a race, with the order matching the VIBGYOR sequence. The winner of the 
           race is determined randomly, making the outcome unpredictable and exciting. As the 
           colorful turtles move across the screen towards the finish line, players can watch 
           the action unfold in a fun and engaging way. With its vibrant graphics and 
           lighthearted gameplay, Turtle Race offers a simple yet entertaining experience that 
           is suitable for all ages.</p>
